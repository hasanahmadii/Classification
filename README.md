Patient Classification Project
In this project, we used the Scikit-Learn library to classify patients based on various indicators such as blood pressure, age, and cholesterol levels. Based on these indicators, appropriate medications are prescribed for individuals. We achieved a high accuracy of 98% in our classification model.
